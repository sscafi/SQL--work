The key difference is the data being passed to the executeQuery(...) method. In the first case,
the parameterized string and the parameters are passed to the database separately, which allows the driver
to correctly interpret them. In the second case, the full SQL statement is constructed before the driver is invoked,
meaning we are vulnerable to maliciously crafted parameters.

You should always use parameterized statements where available, they are your number one protection against SQL injection.
